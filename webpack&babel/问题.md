 ===================================================
### 1: babel-loader: You may need an additional loader to handle the result of these loaders    
```javascript
The problem was the webpack. Since webpack4 does not understand optional-chaing, babel should transpile it. However the default setting of babel-preset-app in server is server: { node: 'current' } and Node 14 understands optional-chaining.
So, babel did not transplie optional-chaing code. Then, webpack threw error since it can not understand optional chaining.

There are two solutions.

1. import @babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining plugin
2. downgrade Node to LTS version
```
