/**

 The assert module provides a simple set of assertion tests that can be used to test invariants.

 buffer

 Prior to the introduction of TypedArray in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), the JavaScript language had no mechanism for
reading or manipulating streams of binary data. The Buffer class was introduced as part of the Node.js API to make
it possible to interact with octet streams in the context of things like TCP streams and file system operations.
